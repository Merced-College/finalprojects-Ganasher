The game is currently going to be about fighting monsters.
I was just going to do random inputs and outputs but it seems to be more fun to add a user element (curtain) in between the reality of just rolling random numbers and that makes room for classes and data tables.
Currently I am harvesting ideas to add elements to the game one by one.
There will be a hero class, a weapon class, and a monster class at least.
These contain the hit point totals of the player and monster, as well as the random damage of the weapons.
Hitting a monster is based on their "AC" which is just the name for a number you must pass to "hit" and then they take "damage" based on the weapon.
Next time I need to figure out how to continualy modify a value of a class object.
Then, after I see the last few Zybooks, I will be prepared to add the final requirements (using the outline to come up with additional idea).

I have now finished the combat loop and figured out how to affect the HP values of the monster and player.
I had to change how I referenced the monster entirely so that it would return a monster into the field of main so I could affect it.

Next up I could:
1. Randomize weapon damage based on name.
2. Have monster battle cries and deathrattles.
3. Have monsters drop gold.

Cleaned up the Code, most of the brackets where not lined up with their start code line.
Added linked list for monster killed list at end of game.

Task 1. 2. and 3. are done. Having too much fun with this! Maybe I should focus on my other classes now lol.
